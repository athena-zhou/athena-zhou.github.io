        <h1 id="h11">The First Transitional Social Housing Set an Example for Future Projects while Failing to Realize
            “Transition” Function</h1>

        <p id="projecttext">
            Nam Cheong 220, the pilot project for Hong Kong transitional social housing, has ended. An exhibition called
            “Our Housing Diary” from Oct 22 to Oct 31 highlighted its achievement, while there are still upcoming issues
            to address.
            <br /><br />
            Transitional social housing, operated by non-government organizations, is provisionally built on vacant
            government or private land to improve living conditions of people in inadequate houses. Nam Cheong 220,
            launched by HKCSS, was the first two-year project put into service.
            <br /><br />
            “It is a good idea, but the project’s duration is short. Thus, whether it truly improves people’s lives
            depends on the next step,” said Maggie Lam, a 50-year-old university staff.
            <br /><br />
            Hong Kong’s housing problem is worsening, significantly threatening low-income groups. According to Housing
            Bureau, 226,340 people—including 43,000 children—live in 100,943 sub-divided units, with 6.6 square meters
            per capita. Subdivided Flat Platform, a Facebook account with 5,573 followers, states five safety concerns
            regarding building load, temporary structure, sanitary condition, drainage condition, and fire risk.
            <br /><br />
            The monthly rent is unaffordable, accounting for about one-third of residents’ income, according to Housing
            Bureau.
            <br /><br />
            Thus, most residents in inadequate housing are queuing for affordable public rental housing. However,
            according to Housing Department, the average queueing time has risen to six years in 2022.
            <br /><br />
            To cope with the dilemma, transitional social housing was launched. The Assessment Committee for Funding
            Scheme to Support Transitional Housing Projects said that HK government had identified sufficient land for
            providing 21,700 units, and the funding amount had reached $11.6 billion.
            <br /><br />
            “It is a good attempt at housing policy,” said Chan Poi Yin, a 43-year-old teacher, taking photos of a
            display board. Meanwhile, 63-year-old former teacher Li Min disagreed. He said, “It is difficult to judge
            whether this is an effective solution since it may require a lot of resources, including labor and funding.”
            <br /><br />
            The board Chan was referring to showed data reflecting living conditions’ improvements in Nam Cheong 220.
            The living space per capita is 97 square feet, 42 square feet larger than residents’ previous inadequate
            housing. The monthly rent is 2953, about 1300 lower than the previous. Each unit has a separate kitchen and
            a washroom.
            <br /><br />
            Furthermore, Nam Cheong 220 set an example in applying Modular Integrated construction, helping to establish
            corresponding legislation and guidelines.
            <br /><br />
            “Sharing Economy” was advocated in the community, encouraging residents to volunteer and share household
            items. “What I miss most is the network of neighbors here, just like a big family. If you don't have dinner,
            neighbors will cook for you. If you are down, you will have someone to trust and talk to,” said A. Liang, a
            50-year-old former resident.
            <br /><br />
            HKU’s senior lecturer commended these practices. “The involvement of NGO in managing a team to support
            building Nam Cheong 220 and enhancing cohesion should be copied to future projects,” said Johnson Cheung.
            <br /><br />
            However, with the project finished, “A key evaluation criterion is the realization of housing’s transition
            function,” said Yun Chuen Wong, a 50-year-old lecturer at HKUSS.
            <br /><br />
            According to Nam Cheong 220’s social impact assessment, 25.5 percent of residents moved to public rental
            housing, 62.8 percent to other transitional social housing, and 11.7 percent back to private housing
            markets.
            <br /><br />
            As successful transitions to public housing were less than failures, the assessment showed that residents’
            biggest concern was to find suitable places and future rent. The second concern was moving expenses and
            children's schooling problems.
            <br /><br />
            An accompanying controversial issue is its short duration, a major cause of transition failure.
            <br /><br />
            “They spend too much time building it,” said Lam. HKCSS spent seven months inviting bids, seven months
            designing and waiting for approval, and seven months constructing.
            <br /><br />
            Funding is another concern. The cost per unit of Nam Cheong 220 is 420,000, just 200,000 lower than that of
            public housing, according to the exhibition and Housing Authority.
            <br /><br />
            So, the biggest question is what the next step should be.
            <br /><br />
            Wallace Chang, the 59-year-old fellow of HKIA, had some practical suggestions. He said, “To reduce cost, the
            scale of transitional social housing should be bigger, with more stories, and materials should be replaced
            with steel. To increase building efficiency, the standardized design explored by Nam Cheong 220 should be
            copied by the following projects.”
            <br /><br />
            For residents’ concerns, Cheung suggested, “Communities and district government may offer living assistance
            or provide subsidies.” He also mentioned NGOs’ efforts in finding land with longer leases.
            <br /><br />
            “The large gap between inadequate housing and public housing won’t be eliminated in recent five years. Thus,
            transitional social housing is answerable to the catch-up of time,” said Chang.
            <br /><br />
            “Hong Kong is always a middle place between east and west. Solutions to housing problems should also be more
            diverse. Transitional social housing is offering more choices for the underrepresented groups,” said Cheung.
