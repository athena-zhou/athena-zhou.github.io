            In late March 2023, Erwin Huang, a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, asked
            artificial
            intelligent (AI) chatbot ChatGPT to give him 50 ways to engage with elderly people, as educators in the city
            flock to use AI to innovate their work.
            <br /><br />
            After a brisk “sure,” ChatGPT wrote 50 ways at a speed of 300 words per second.
            <br /><br />
            “However good you are, coming up with 10 ways to engage elderlies is already very good,” said Huang, who is
            a pioneer in using ChatGPT in education, “You might be a social worker, then fifteen ways. Fifty ways? It's
            ridiculous.”
            <br /><br />
            The 48th way, “Create a memoir or personal history,” aroused Huang’s interest. He clicked the URL of one
            example given by ChatGPT but encountered a big “Error 404: Page Not Found”. He then searched it on Google,
            but still no information.
            <br /><br />
            “Maybe ChatGPT makes it up, but the interesting thing is that you get 50 ideas in two seconds, choose one to
            look into, and spend one month validating it with your team through practice,” said Huang.
            <br /><br />
            On Nov. 30, 2022, U.S. company OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a conversational generative AI model. Generative AI
            describes algorithms that can be used to create new content based on past training data, according to
            McKinsey. Besides ChatGPT, DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and New Bing are famous examples.
            <br /><br />
            On March 14, GPT-4, the upgraded version of ChatGPT, came out, drawing more and more attention on how it may
            impact education. GPT-4 can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy, broader general knowledge, and
            problem-solving abilities, according to OpenAI.
            <br /><br />
            The results already are compelling. ChatGPT has passed the US medical licensing exam, according to a journal
            article in medRxiv. Open AI says on its website that GPT-4 places in the 90th percentile in the Uniform Bar
            Exam of US, while ChatGPT-3.5 only places in the 10th percentile.
            <br /><br />
            In reaction to the risk of students using ChatGPT to get answers in exams, the University of Hong Kong
            initially banned the use of ChatGPT on Feb.17, but from April 17 allowed teachers to experiment with it. It
            plans to hold debates in May to design long-term policy, according to Vice President Lan Holiday’s emails.
            <br /><br />
            Another university in the city, Lingnan University, temporarily banned students from using ChatGPT on Feb.
            27, according to the school’s email. On Feb.22, Baptist University cautioned students against the use of
            ChatGPT in email.
            <br /><br />
            But not all universities in the city banned AI in education. HKUST gave flexibility for using ChatGPT on
            March 2 and City University also encouraged the proper use of ChatGPT on April 13, according to emails from
            the universities. HKUST has already offered courses to instruct using AI, including Huang’s one, while CityU
            says the school will provide training for students on how to use AI acceptably.
            <br /><br />
            Outside Hong Kong, the UK has published a policy paper on its government website to guide the use of AI in
            education, while Italy banned ChatGPT, according to GPDP, the Italian Data Protection Authority.
            <br /><br />
            In Hong Kong, many people are unable to use ChatGPT since OpenAI does not allow users based in Hong Kong and
            mainland China to register on the platform. Many HKU students seek to purchase ChatGPT accounts on HKU
            anonymous forums. By contrast, ChatGPT has been available on HKUST website for staff and students for a long
            time.
            <br /><br />
            Despite the different reactions, all universities in Hong Kong are exploring the best way to use ChatGPT in
            the classroom and define what is acceptable. As they work towards coming up with a framework, teachers are
            coming up with their own plans.
            <br /><br />
            Considering ChatGPT’s threat to academic integrity, “What we will bring back are oral and written
            examinations,” said Stefan Auer, an HKU associate professor in European studies.
            <br /><br />
            This has been put into practice. In HKU’s introductory translation course, Song Geng, a professor,
            prohibited students from using AI. Only traditional dictionaries are allowed.
            <br /><br />
            “To ensure fairness, I can only assess in the most primitive method--a pen and a piece of paper. But when
            students graduate and work, it is impossible to translate without AI, so how much use is this method? It is
            difficult to say. This approach should change in the future,” said Song.
            <br /><br />
            Huang also criticized current assessment for being designed for the end of study rather than the learning
            process. “Now we need ‘assessment for learning.’ Show me how you ask ChatGPT questions, and I will grade the
            process you choose to come to a conclusion,” said Huang.
            <br /><br />
            Tony Lam, a senior advisor in consulting, suggested another promising method, asking students to
            self-criticize, disclose details, and give explanations after using ChatGPT. “That means you are not easily
            fooled by machines and have independent capability,” said Lam.
            <br /><br />
            Some teachers think ChatGPT may also facilitate teaching. The 44-year-old journalism professor Luo Xingxing
            considered comparing ChatGPT’s answers and students’ answers for the same question as a good teaching
            approach. “This kind of debate or discussion format can help lecturers actively interact with students and
            compensate for the disadvantage of their fixed thinking,” said Qin Zhiqiang, a 50-year-old researcher.
            <br /><br />
            However, students’ use of ChatGPT is more controversial than how teachers will use it in the classroom. The
            harm to critical thinking ability is the primary concern.
            <br /><br />
            “We hope our students are equipped with critical thinking, but you will not acquire that through using
            ChatGPT as a shortcut to accomplishment,” said Auer. According to a poll conducted by Decoded Reality on
            Twitter with 228 people voting, 62 percent of voters disagreed that ChatGPT helps build critical thinking.
            <br /><br />
            Huang argued that students could still learn critical thinking, but in an innovative way. “The best way is
            to use the Socratic method, the origin of critical thinking. Students should learn to keep asking right
            questions and drilling in ChatGPT’s answer, as Socrates, then validate it. Students shall comment on each
            other’s interaction with ChatGPT to see different angles,” said Huang.
            <br /><br />
            Xue Runze supported Huang’s opinion. He is a 23-year-old HKU postgraduate student who uses ChatGPT to write
            code. “ChatGPT improves efficiency, but the prerequisite is that questions or prompts are appropriate,” said
            Runze.
            <br /><br />
            Lam called the way of asking questions and choosing information “methodology” and said methodology was what
            students should focus on when using ChatGPT.
            <br /><br />
            Additionally, ChatGPT seemed to be a good helper in personalized learning.
            <br /><br />
            “When I copy someone else’s code and I can’t understand because he doesn’t comment, I will have ChatGPT
            explained,” said Zheng Jiayi, a 22-year-old research assistant at HKU, in an excited tone.
            <br /><br />
            Regarding the ethical challenges brought by ChatGPT, such as cheating and copyright, Luo said that these
            require everyone to have a more rigorous and responsible attitude. She thought the learning of ethical
            morality will become increasingly important in the era of AI.
            <br /><br />
            Lam agreed with her emphasis on ethics. “I am not so afraid of machines thinking like humans, but much more
            worried about humans thinking like machines,” said Lam, “That’s why we must teach students how to use
            ChatGPT.”
            <br /><br />
            In line with Lam’s idea, Huang has started teaching on using ChatGPT. “After my course, students will know
            how to use ChatGPT in different ways, so it becomes a transferable skill. The bonus I reward them for using
            ChatGPT is small, just an incentive to encourage use,” said Huang, “Frankly, in the future, everyone will be
            using it. That’s why we push it so fast.”
